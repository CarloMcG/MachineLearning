# Machine Learning
A sample application created as part of a Machine Learning module at NUI Galway
## Classification Algorithms
This repo contains 2 Classification algorithms(K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine) created as a solution for an assignment.
These algorithms were developed using the scikit-learn package for python

The goal of this assingment was to classify beer samples into different types (*Ale*,*Lager*,*Stout* based on the following attributes:
- Calorific Value
- Nitrogen
- Turbidity
